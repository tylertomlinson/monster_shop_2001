Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
  - Aim for a three all categories.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
  - Team-builidng, organizing, planning, communication, task-oriented, flexibility, openness to new ideas. Prefer driver-navigate to do setup/prerequisites and then assign closely-related stories for pairs. Assign chunks at a time.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  - Doing certain steps together to avoid re-doing code, frequent retros (goal of two/day -- more or less as needed), we'll use Trello to track and plan our progress.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
  - Frequent retros, big decisions made over a call, quick decisions over Slack. Be upfront and communicate feelings whenever.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  - Implement Bootstrap, improve familiarity with ActiveRecord/SQL
  
Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  - Even distribution of responsibilities. Work off suggested timeline and determine our strengths and interests.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  - Do not merge to PRs to master by yourself, use PR template to review changes, two reviewers per PR before merging, occasional automated code review.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  - 5 minutes every 30.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  - Specific, actionable, kind, assume/approach with good intent and have good reasons. Timely and straightforward feedback to avoid future problems.
