**ALWAYS PULL FROM MASTER BEFORE CREATING PR**

### All Submissions:

* [ ] Have you followed the guidelines in our Contributing document? (need to decided as group what to put here)
* [ ] Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](../../../pulls)? (for reducing merge conflicts)

### New Feature Submissions:

* [ ] Have you added an explanation of what your changes do?
* [ ] Have you lint your code locally prior to submission?

### Testing:

* [ ] Does your submission pass tests?
* [ ] Have you written new tests for your core changes, as applicable?
* [ ] Have you successfully ran tests with your changes locally?
